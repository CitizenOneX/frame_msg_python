# Frame Message Package

A Python package for handling various types of messages for the Brilliant Labs Frame, including sprites, text, audio, IMU data, and photos.

## Installation

```bash
pip install frame-msg
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from frame_msg import FrameMsg, TxSprite

async def main():
    """
    Displays sample images on the Frame display.

    The images are indexed (palette) PNG images, in 2, 4, and 16 colors (that is, 1-, 2- and 4-bits-per-pixel).

    They are using the standard palette from the Frame firmware. If you want to display sprites that have
    palettes of other colors, the frameside app must call `sprite.set_palette()` (which lua/sprite_frame_app.lua does)
    or call the underlying `frame.display.assign_color()` before the `frame.display.bitmap()` call.

    frame = FrameMsg()
    try:
        await frame.connect()

        # debug only: check our current battery level and memory usage (which varies between 16kb and 31kb or so even after the VM init)
        batt_mem = await frame.send_lua('print(frame.battery_level() .. " / " .. collectgarbage("count"))', await_print=True)
        print(f"Battery Level/Memory used: {batt_mem}")

        # Let the user know we're starting
        await frame.print_short_text('Loading...')

        # send the std lua files to Frame that handle data accumulation and sprite parsing
        await frame.upload_stdlua_libs(lib_names=['data', 'sprite'])

        # Send the main lua application from this project to Frame that will run the app
        await frame.upload_frame_app(local_filename="lua/sprite_frame_app.lua")

        # attach the print response handler so we can see stdout from Frame Lua print() statements
        # If we assigned this handler before the frameside app was running,
        # any await_print=True commands will echo the acknowledgement byte (e.g. "1"), but if we assign
        # the handler now we'll see any lua exceptions (or stdout print statements)

        # code directly (in fact, we would need to send a break_signal if we wanted to because
